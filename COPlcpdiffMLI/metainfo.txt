Name of Quantlet: COPlcpdiffMLI

Published in: Time-varying Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas Using Adaptively Simulated Critical Values

Description: 'Calculates and plots the no. of different test steps per time point for the two approaches 
of LCP. The results from LCP correspond to the approach with pre-simulated critical values and the 
approach with adaptively simulated critical values. In addition, the dynamics of the difference in the ML 
criterion are plotted as well. The estimated model is a three-dimensional HAC with Gumbel generators.'
